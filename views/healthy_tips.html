                    <h2>My Type 2 Diabetes Journey: From Crisis to Control</h2>
                    <p>
                        I have type 2 diabetes, and I managed to take control of it with the right diet. These are the
                        recipes I
                        created, and these are the photos I took myself—simple, real, no frills.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You won’t find long stories or ads cluttering the way to my recipes. I’m not here to sell
                        supplements,
                        and I’m not backed by any brands. This is purely for you and your family’s health.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At one point, my HbA1c spiked to 110 mmol/mol (12.2% in American units), which was dangerously
                        high.
                        HbA1c measures your average blood sugar levels over the last two to three months. It gives you a
                        clearer picture of your long-term blood sugar control. I didn’t listen to my body for far too
                        long,
                        and it caught up with me. But in just two months, I’ve already managed to bring my HbA1c back
                        down
                        to near normal levels.
                    </p>
                    <p>Here's the latest progress—this graph shows my long-term HbA1c improvement:</p>

                    <p>
                        Remember, always consult with your doctor. I’m not a doctor myself; I have a science background
                        but
                        no
                        formal training as a dietician. I just love food—too much, in fact, and that was my undoing. Now
                        it’s time to use that love for food to make healthier choices and help others avoid the same
                        mistakes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I don’t use fancy photography to make the recipes look better than they are. What you see is
                        what
                        you get, and sometimes, it might not look great—but it will always be easy and healthy!
                        Everything
                        is created in my own kitchen with no special restaurant gadgets; just like in yours. I do
                        recommend
                        a few tools (see
                        <a href="../healthy-tips">Healthy Tips</a>), but nothing you can’t get at a local shop.

                        <h3>Keeping My Blood Sugar in Check</h3>
                        <p>
                            Since adopting this diet, my blood sugar has remained well-controlled. As you can see from
                            the
                            chart, my
                            average blood sugar sits around 5.2 mmol/L (93.6 mg/dL in American units), with a variation
                            of
                            ±0.8
                            mmol/L (±14.4 mg/dL).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Maintaining these levels is crucial to avoid dangerous spikes or drops in blood sugar, which
                            can
                            cause
                            long-term complications if left unmanaged. The goal for most people with diabetes is to keep
                            their blood
                            sugar between 4.0–7.0 mmol/L (72–126 mg/dL) before meals. This range can vary depending on
                            individual health
                            circumstances, so always consult with your healthcare provider.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You don’t need fancy or expensive food to achieve these numbers—just smart meal planning and
                            a
                            bit of
                            dedication. It's about eating balanced, real food, and monitoring how your body responds.
                            These
                            recipes are
                            designed to help you keep things simple but effective.
