                    <h3>1. I am not a doctor</h3>
                    <p>I do not offer medical advice. Always consult your medical professionals for any health-related
                        concerns. Please do not ask me for medical advice, as I cannot provide it.</p>

                    <h3>2. I am not a chef</h3>
                    <p>I love cooking and sharing recipes, but I am not a professional chef. The title of my website is
                        meant to be tongue-in-cheek—while I am Swedish and often Naked, I am not a chef by any means.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3. My background in science</h3>
                    <p>I have a background in science, which influences my research process. I approach my recipes with
                        a scientific mindset, ensuring they are well-researched and practical.</p>

                    <h3>4. I am Swedish (but no surströmming for me)</h3>
                    <p>Yes, I’m Swedish, but I do not eat surströmming. Don’t worry—my citizenship is secure!</p>

                    <h3>5. Cookies - both edible and digital</h3>
                    <p>I bake cookies without sugar, but more importantly, this site does not use tracking cookies. I do
                        not collect any personal data, track users, or sell advertising. This is a safe space, and your
                        privacy is respected.</p>

                    <h3>6. Supporting the site</h3>
                    <p>If you find the resources here helpful, you can support the site by using the affiliate links I
                        provide. I may earn a small commission when you purchase items through my links, but it costs
                        you nothing extra.</p>

                    <h3>7. Not a chef, remember?</h3>
                    <p>While I research my recipes thoroughly, I can’t guarantee every recipe will suit your taste.
                        Cooking is subjective, so experiment and choose wisely!</p>

                    <h3>8. Sharing is caring</h3>
                    <p>Feel free to share this site with others! It’s open to everyone, so don’t keep it a secret.</p>

                    <h3>9. About the images</h3>
                    <p>Some images on the site are AI-generated to help keep the site free, but all the photos of
                        recipes I’ve made are real and taken by me, with no fancy studio involved. It’s just me, my
                        kitchen, and my camera.</p>
                    <h3>10. Allergies</h3>
                    <p>It is important for individuals to carefully review the ingredients used in each recipe to ensure they are safe to
                        consume, based on personal dietary needs and allergies. While I do my best to provide healthy and balanced recipes,
                        it’s up to you to verify if the ingredients fit your requirements. Always consult the ingredient labels for
                        allergens before preparing any dish.</p>
