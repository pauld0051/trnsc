            <p>
                Toasting your nuts is more than just a way to bring out extra flavor—it also comes with several health
                benefits, especially for those managing type 2 diabetes. Whether you snack on almonds, cashews, or
                walnuts, taking the time to toast them can make a difference in how they taste and how your body absorbs
                their nutrients.
            </p>

            <h3>1. Enhanced Flavor and Texture</h3>
            <p>
                Toasting nuts intensifies their natural flavors and gives them a satisfying crunch. This simple step can
                turn a good snack into a great one, making it more enjoyable to eat.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Easier Digestion</h3>
            <p>
                Toasted nuts are generally easier to digest compared to raw nuts. The roasting process helps break down
                some of the complex compounds found in nuts, making them gentler on your stomach.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Reduced Risk of Harmful Bacteria</h3>
            <p>
                Raw nuts can sometimes carry harmful bacteria like Salmonella or E. coli. Roasting or toasting them
                reduces the risk of exposure to these pathogens, making toasted nuts a safer snack option.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Nutrient Retention</h3>
            <p>
                Although toasting nuts may cause a slight reduction in heat-sensitive nutrients, such as vitamin E, the
                overall nutrient content remains similar to raw nuts. You’ll still benefit from their healthy fats,
                fiber, and protein content. In fact, some antioxidants may become more bioavailable after toasting.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Antioxidant Benefits</h3>
            <p>
                Nuts are rich in antioxidants, which help fight oxidative stress in the body. Roasting or toasting can
                sometimes enhance the availability of these antioxidants, giving you even more health benefits.
            </p>

            <h3>How to Toast Nuts for Maximum Health Benefits</h3>
            <p>
                To toast nuts with minimal nutrient loss and maximum flavor, follow these simple steps:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 150°C (300°F) for a slow, even roast that preserves nutrients.</li>
                <li>Spread your nuts in a single layer on a baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Toast for 10-15 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes to ensure even browning.</li>
                <li>Once golden and fragrant, remove from the oven and let them cool completely.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                For a quick stovetop method:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Heat a dry frying pan over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Add nuts in a single layer, stirring frequently to prevent burning.</li>
                <li>Toast for 5-7 minutes until golden and fragrant.</li>
                <li>Immediately remove from heat and let them cool.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This method toasts nuts faster, but make sure to stir constantly to avoid burning, especially since the pan heats
                unevenly.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you prefer to avoid added oils or salt, simply toast your nuts dry in the oven. For those managing
                type 2 diabetes, toasted nuts are a great snack option—providing healthy fats and fiber to help
                stabilize blood sugar levels without the risk of a glucose spike.
            </p>
