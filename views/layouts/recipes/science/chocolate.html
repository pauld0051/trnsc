                    <h2>I Made 100% Cocoa Chocolate – and It Was as Bitter as Hell! But It Was Worth It!</h2>
                    <p>
                        It started with an idea: could I make chocolate healthier? Chocolate is already healthy in many ways, but what if I
                        could remove the sugar entirely, without substituting it with any artificial flavors? This was the beginning of my
                        journey. It all started when I found cocoa nibs on Amazon. I was adding them raw to my cereal. They smelled fantastic,
                        just like perfect pure chocolate. Nothing smells as good. They even smelled sweet. But they were anything but.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To grind the cocoa nibs into a fine powder the blender didn’t need to be professional. I used a cheap smoothie maker that ground the nibs to a fine dust and began
                        to release some of the oils from the nibs. But it wasn’t liquid enough to pour just yet. Professionals use machines that grind the nibs until they're liquid, but 
                        I did this using no special equipment to prove anyone can make their own healthy and pure chocolate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, why even bother with such bitter chocolate?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For diabetics, chocolate might have been one of the reasons we got here in the first place. But that flavor isn’t just a
                        luxury confectionery. Cocoa, in its purest form, is actually a powerhouse of antioxidants. It’s like the superhero of
                        foods, but without the cape. The real kicker? It’s bitter – as bitter as that one friend who can’t let go of their high
                        school breakup. However, if you can push past the intense flavor, you’ll be treating your body to a whole host of health
                        benefits.

                                    unadulterated, bitter chocolate looks like. Delicious? We'll see...</em>

                    <p>
                        After grinding the cocoa nibs in my blender for what felt like an eternity (pro tip: your blender may overheat before
                        you finish), I ended up with a fine but somewhat sticky powder. It didn’t quite reach that dreamy, smooth, melted
                        chocolate consistency we all know and love. No worries, I thought – the real challenge lies ahead: facing the taste.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Professional chocolatiers would have specialized equipment at this stage, but I was just using simple home tools. I
                        heated the ground cocoa nib powder over a double boiler, adding nothing but pure vanilla essence (because I like living on the edge). The
                        aroma? Divine. The taste? Well, it's not for everyone. Without sugar, the chocolate is
                        difficult to describe. It has a real chocolate taste that lingers. It’s fresh, but you can’t eat a lot. Yet, it is
                        satisfying. It has a real snap and crunch. The smell, though, you can’t get that out of your head—it’s amazing. The
                        lingering taste feels like you’ve eaten the finest chocolate in the world, and you forget the need for sugar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can do it without sugar, but if you’re not brave, add sugar to taste (small amounts as we’re cutting sugar out) in
                        the double boiler and mix properly. You can add erythritol or similar for flavor too, but I am also avoiding artificial
                        sweeteners and other natural alternatives. But you don’t have to be that brave.
                    </p>
                    <p>Here's the result—this is what 100% pure cocoa chocolate looks like:</p>

                        But hey, before you think this was all for nothing, let me tell you something about appreciating the
                        raw. The body actually craves purity sometimes (even if the tongue protests), and after a while, the
                        bitterness becomes... character-building.

                        <h3>Why Bother With Pure Cocoa?</h3>
                        <p>
                            So, why even put yourself through this? It turns out, there’s a science to it. Cocoa is packed with flavonoids that
                            improve blood flow to the brain and heart<sup>1</sup>. In fact, studies have shown that consuming dark chocolate (with
                            at least 70%
                            cocoa) can help reduce blood pressure and lower the risk of heart disease<sup>1</sup>. But when you hit 100% cocoa,
                            you’re not just
                            getting a snack—you’re practically consuming medicine<sup>1, 2</sup>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Still, don’t expect this chocolate to taste like your favourite supermarket bar. In its purest
                            form, cocoa is unapologetically bitter. But hey, it’s also unapologetically good for you. Over
                            time, you’ll start to appreciate its complex flavours (or at least convince yourself to).

                        <p>
                            If you still want to make your own 100% cocoa chocolate (and I totally recommend it if you want
                            to flex your bitterness tolerance), here’s how you do it:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Get yourself some high-quality cocoa nibs. Amazon will have plenty of options.</li>
                            <li>Use a blender or food processor to grind the nibs into the finest powder you can manage.
                            </li>
                            <li>Heat the ground nibs in a double boiler until they melt into a pourable consistency.</li>
                            <li>Add a splash of vanilla essence, or if you’re feeling adventurous, leave it out for an even
                                more hardcore experience.</li>
                            <li>Pour into moulds and let it set in the fridge.</li>
                            <li>Brace yourself for that first bite—it’s bitter, but oh-so-worth it (in a masochistic sort of
                                way).</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Feeling brave? Give it a go! Or maybe just add a bit of sugar next time.</p>
