                    <h2>I Made 100% Cocoa Chocolate – and It Was Bitter Enough to Question My Life Choices!</h2>
                    <p>
                        It all started with a wild idea. I decided to make pure, 100%, totally sugar-free, no additives, and
                        basically raw chocolate using cocoa nibs I found on Amazon. Why? Because sometimes, life needs a bit
                        of a challenge. Also, I'm a sucker for punishment, apparently.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You don’t need much: some patience, a blender that can grind like it's 2050, and a tongue strong
                        enough to handle the bitter wrath of pure cocoa. But first, why even bother with chocolate, right? I
                        mean, it’s just bitter cocoa, no sugar, no fun... or is it?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cocoa, in its purest form, is actually a powerhouse of antioxidants. It’s like the superhero of
                        foods, but without the cape. The real kicker? It’s bitter – as bitter as that one friend who can't
                        let go of their high school breakup. However, if you can push past the intense flavour, you’ll be
                        treating your body to a whole host of health benefits.
                    </p>

                                    unadulterated, bitter chocolate looks like. Delicious? We'll see...</em>

                    <p>
                        But let's get down to business. After grinding the cocoa nibs in my blender for what felt like an
                        eternity (pro tip: your blender may overheat before you finish), I ended up with a fine powder that
                        didn’t quite reach that dreamy, smooth, melted chocolate consistency we all know and love. No
                        worries, I thought – the real challenge lies ahead: facing the taste.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I heated the powder over a double boiler, adding nothing but pure, vanilla essence (because I like
                        living on the edge). The aroma? Divine. The taste? Well, let’s just say I have a newfound respect
                        for the sugar industry.
                    </p>
                    <p>Here's the result—this is what 100% pure cocoa chocolate looks like:</p>

                        But hey, before you think this was all for nothing, let me tell you something about appreciating the
                        raw. The body actually craves purity sometimes (even if the tongue protests), and after a while, the
                        bitterness becomes... character-building.

                        <h3>Why Bother With Pure Cocoa?</h3>
                        <p>
                            So, why even put yourself through this? It turns out, there’s a science to it. Cocoa is packed
                            with flavonoids that improve blood flow to the brain and heart. In fact, studies have shown that
                            consuming dark chocolate (with at least 70% cocoa) can help reduce blood pressure and lower the
                            risk of heart disease. But when you hit 100% cocoa, you’re not just getting a snack—you’re
                            practically consuming medicine.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Still, don’t expect this chocolate to taste like your favourite supermarket bar. In its purest
                            form, cocoa is unapologetically bitter. But hey, it’s also unapologetically good for you. Over
                            time, you’ll start to appreciate its complex flavours (or at least convince yourself to).

                        <p>
                            If you still want to make your own 100% cocoa chocolate (and I totally recommend it if you want
                            to flex your bitterness tolerance), here’s how you do it:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Get yourself some high-quality cocoa nibs. Amazon will have plenty of options.</li>
                            <li>Use a blender or food processor to grind the nibs into the finest powder you can manage.
                            </li>
                            <li>Heat the ground nibs in a double boiler until they melt into a pourable consistency.</li>
                            <li>Add a splash of vanilla essence, or if you’re feeling adventurous, leave it out for an even
                                more hardcore experience.</li>
                            <li>Pour into moulds and let it set in the fridge.</li>
                            <li>Brace yourself for that first bite—it’s bitter, but oh-so-worth it (in a masochistic sort of
                                way).</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Feeling brave? Give it a go! Or maybe just add a bit of sugar next time.</p>
