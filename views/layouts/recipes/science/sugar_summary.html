                    <p></p>
                    <p>Sugar is essential for energy but overconsumption, especially from added sugars, contributes to
                        various health issues like obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. While natural
                        sugars from fruits and vegetables offer nutrients and fibre, refined sugars can cause blood sugar
                        spikes, leading to metabolic problems. How can we manage sugar consumption in a world filled with
                        hidden sugars?</p>
                    <p>This summary dives into the good, the bad, and the ugly of sugar. Discover the types of sugars, their
                        role in diabetes, how to spot hidden sugars, and explore natural alternatives and the science behind
                        it all.</p>

                                sugar consumption in the US, including refined cane and beet sugar, high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), and
                                other sugars. Total sugar consumption peaked in 1999 at 111 g/day, with a notable increase in HFCS use.
                                Despite a decline in sugar consumption since 2000, obesity rates have not shown a corresponding
                                decrease, suggesting a more complex relationship between sugar intake and obesity.</em> Source: <a

                    <p>Sugar comes in various formsâ€”monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides. While it is a vital
                        source of energy, refined sugars have a harmful impact on blood sugar levels. Learn how the body
                        reacts to natural versus added sugars.</p>

                    <p>Hidden sugars in processed foods can sneak into your diet and spike your blood sugar unexpectedly.
                        Learn how to spot hidden sugars on labels, and why complex carbohydrates from whole grains and
                        vegetables are better choices for blood glucose control.</p>
    
                    <h3>Natural and Artificial Alternatives</h3>
                    <p>Looking for a sugar substitute? Explore natural alternatives like stevia, monk fruit, and sugar
                        alcohols. These options have minimal effects on blood sugar, but come with their own considerations.
                        Moderation is key to their safe use.</p>
