      "Prepare the Sweet Potato Fries: Preheat the oven to 180°C. Place the mandolin-sliced sweet potato in a bowl, drizzle with olive oil and a pinch of salt, then let it sit for 10 minutes.

      "Prepare and Roast the Lamb: Preheat the oven to 125°C. Rub the lamb with olive oil, salt, and rosemary, making small incisions to insert the garlic slices. Roast for 2–2.5 hours or until the thermometer reads 60–70°C (medium-rare to medium). Remove from the oven, cover with foil, and let it rest for 15–30 minutes.",
      "Prepare Vegetables: Toss the celeriac, carrots, and Brussels sprouts with olive oil, garlic powder, smoked paprika, thyme (optional), salt, and pepper. Spread evenly on a lined baking tray.",
      "<u>Last 10 Minutes of Lamb Cooking Time:</u> Place your muffin tins or ovenproof soufflé molds with ½–1 tsp of sunflower or avocado oil in each hole into the oven to heat. This ensures the oil is hot for the Yorkshire pudding batter.",
      "Increase Temperature: Once the lamb is done, take it out to rest. Immediately increase the oven temperature to 190°C. Leave the muffin tins in the oven to let the oil heat fully (about 4 or 5 minutes as the oven warms).",
      "Quickly remove the hot muffin tins, pour the batter into the oil-filled holes (about three-quarters full), and return to the oven.",
      "Cook Vegetables and Yorkshire Puddings: Once the oven reaches 190°C, place the vegetables in the oven and roast for 25–30 minutes, flipping halfway through. Bake the Yorkshire puddings alongside the vegetables for 25–30 minutes without opening the oven door.",
      "Make Lamb Sauce: While the vegetables and puddings cook, combine the lamb drippings, stock, balsamic vinegar, and psyllium husk in a saucepan. Heat gently and whisk until smooth and thickened. Simmer for 1–2 minutes until the sauce reaches your desired consistency.",

    tips: [
      "Yorkshire puddings rely on very hot oil for puffiness—don’t skip this step!",
