      "Prepare the Sweet Potato Fries: Preheat the oven to 180°C. Place the mandolin-sliced sweet potato in a bowl, drizzle with olive oil and a pinch of salt, then let it sit for 10 minutes.

      "Cook the Bacon: While the fries are baking, heat a non-stick pan over medium heat. Add the bacon rashers and cook slowly to render the fat. Cook the bacon until it's crispy and browned to your liking. Remove from the pan and set aside, leaving the rendered fat in the pan.",
