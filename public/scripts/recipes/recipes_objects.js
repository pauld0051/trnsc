      "Cook the Bacon: While the fries are baking, heat a non-stick pan over medium heat. Add the bacon rashers and cook slowly to render the fat. Cook the bacon until it's crispy and browned to your liking. Remove from the pan and set aside, leaving the rendered fat in the pan.",
      "Fry the Eggs: Using the bacon fat left in the pan, crack the eggs into the pan and fry them until the whites are set, but the yolks remain runny, about 2-3 minutes. You can cook them longer if you prefer your eggs fully cooked.",
      "Steam the Broccoli: While the eggs are cooking, steam the broccoli florets in a separate pot for about 5-7 minutes, or until tender but still vibrant green.",
      "Serve: Plate the bacon and eggs with the sweet potato fries on the side. Add the steamed broccoli for extra fibre. Enjoy this balanced meal of protein, healthy fats, and a dose of veggies.",
    ],
    tips: [
      "Treat yourself: While bacon isn't the healthiest choice, it's okay to enjoy a treat like this once in a while. Cooking the eggs in the rendered bacon fat adds flavour without additional oils.",
      "Sweet potato fries: For an even crispier result, try flipping the fries halfway through baking or broiling them for the last few minutes.",
      "Add variety: You can swap the broccoli for other high-fibre veggies like spinach, kale, or green beans.",

      "Cook the Bulgur Wheat: In a saucepan, bring the mushroom stock to a boil. Add the bulgur wheat, reduce the heat, and simmer for 12-15 minutes until the liquid is absorbed, and the bulgur is tender. Fluff with a fork once cooked.",
      "Prepare the Tomato and Basil Sauce: Heat the olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, sautéing until softened and fragrant, about 3-4 minutes. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, basil, marjoram, salt, and pepper. Let the sauce simmer for 10-15 minutes until it thickens slightly.",
      "Heat the Chicken: While the sauce simmers, warm the pre-cooked chicken in the microwave or in a separate pan.",
      "Serve: Plate the cooked bulgur wheat, top with the sliced or shredded chicken, and pour the tomato and basil sauce generously over the top.",

    tips: [

    method: [
      "Set up a double boiler: Fill the bottom pot with water and place the cocoa butter in the top pot. Heat gently until fully melted.",
      "Slowly whisk in the cocoa powder: Once the cocoa butter is melted, slowly whisk in the cocoa powder until completely dissolved and smooth.",
      "Add the peanut butter: Whisk in the peanut butter until fully incorporated and the mixture is smooth.",
      "Pour into a mould or tin: Pour the mixture into a 40cm cake tin (or smaller moulds) to set. The thin layer helps the chocolate achieve a shiny finish.",
      "Let it set: Allow the chocolate to set at room temperature, then break into small pieces for serving. Store in an airtight container to keep it fresh.",
    ],
    tips: [
      "Refined vs. Raw: For a more raw and intense flavour, you can use cacao powder instead of cocoa powder, but since we’re keeping it sugar-free, refined cocoa provides a smoother, less overpowering flavour.",
      "Sweeteners: If the bitterness is too much, feel free to add a diabetic-friendly sweetener like erythritol or stevia. However, it’s good to train your palate to enjoy the natural bitterness and richness of the cocoa.",
      "Texture Boost: For a creamier chocolate, you can add a tablespoon of milk powder during the whisking process. This adds a smoother texture and softens the overall flavour.",
      "Peanut Butter: Feel free to increase the amount of peanut butter for a stronger nutty flavour, or replace it with almond butter for variation.",
      "Moderation: This chocolate is quite rich and satisfying. A little bit goes a long way, so break small pieces to serve.",
